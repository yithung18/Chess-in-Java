# Chess-in-Java
There are 5 types of pieces that is TOR, XOR, SAU, RAM, and BIZ.
- The Ram piece can only move forward, 1 step. If it reaches the end of the board, it turns around and starts heading back the other way. It cannot skip over other pieces.
- The Biz piece moves in a 3x2 L shape in any orientation (kind of like the knight in standard chess.) This is the only piece that can skip over other pieces.
- The Tor piece can move orthogonally only but can go any distance. It cannot skip over other pieces. However, after 2 turns, it transforms into the Xor piece.
- The Xor piece can move diagonally only but can go any distance. It cannot skip over other pieces. However, after 2 turns, it transforms into the Tor piece.
- The Sau piece can move only one step in any direction. The game ends when the Sau is captured by the other side.
